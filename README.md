# RTLIT

If you use a RightToLeft language, then you have seen what would happen if a website does not handle RTL text very well. You have probably seen such thing:
![not-rtl-imagex](./.github/images/not-rtl.png)

Using this browser extension could help you out to fix these type of texts.
![rtled-image](./.github/images/rtled.png)

Unfortunatly I could not publish this extension on Chrome Web Store. But you can download the zip file [release](https://www.github.com/mahdiAghaei1/rtlit/releases) and follow these instructions:

1. Download the zip release
2. Unzip it and keep it in a directory
3. Go to `chrome://extension`
4. Turn on developer mode
5. Click on Load unpacked extension
6. Choose to the directory you just unziped
7. Enjoy!

If you had any problem following these instructions, you can use [this](https://browsertouse.com/blog/23621/install-chrome-extension-from-zip/) tutorial too.
Sorry if it's a lot of work. Hopfully I can release this extension on the official Chrome Web Store soon.
